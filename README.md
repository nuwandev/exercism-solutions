# 🧠 Exercism Solutions

Welcome to my **Exercism Solutions** repository! This is where I document my hands-on journey through coding challenges on [Exercism.org](https://exercism.org/).

Every solution here is written by me and reflects my own problem-solving approach and learning progress.

> ⚡ This repo updates automatically as I complete exercises — great for tracking consistent progress!

---

## 📘 Current Focus

- 🔥 **Main Track:** JavaScript (in progress)
- ⏳ Other languages may be added later

> I'm currently focused on completing the **JavaScript track**, which covers essential and advanced programming concepts using practical exercises.

---

## 📈 Progress Stats

<!-- STATS_START -->
- ✅ **Total JavaScript Exercises Completed:** 0
- 📁 **Total Files:** 0 `.js` files
- 🌐 **Languages Solved In:** JavaScript (only, for now!)
<!-- STATS_END -->

> _This section can auto-update with each commit using GitHub Actions and a simple script. Want to contribute that? Let’s collaborate!_

## 🚀 Why I’m Doing This

- To sharpen my problem-solving and logic
- To master JavaScript from the ground up
- To build a consistent coding habit

---

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- 🖋 JavaScript (ES6+)
- 🧪 Node.js (for some test environments)
- ✅ Markdown for documentation

## 🤖 Automation (coming soon)

> I plan to add a GitHub Action that:
- Counts `.js` files automatically
- Updates the `📈 Progress Stats` section
- Runs on every push
